This machine not only offers tons of speed and a comfy keyboard that's made for epic typing sessions but also lasts nearly 9 hours on a single charge.,The Latitude 7490's battery life doesn't match that of some competitors, and its underside can get warm, but this laptop packs nearly everything you need to become your team's MVP.</h4>

                <p></p>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The Pavilion line has always represented HP's consumer mid-range marque, and this 15-incher slots right in; it's a not-quite-ultrabook laptop that truly has a lot going for it. The model we have here is absolutely bursting with high-spec hardware, from 16GB RAM to a speedy 512GB SSD, from a touch-screen 15.3-inch FHD display to a 4th-gen AMD Ryzen 7 processor. It's a strong contender for a place on our best laptops list.
                    For the most part it absolutely rocks those components, getting results which, while not quite reaching as high as the lofty mark set by the top end of Intel's 11th-gen mobile processors, are truly creditable.
                    All of those guts are packed (literally to the point of bursting) into a handsome and defiantly attractive case, a slim-enough form which looks pricier than it is, and given more than enough ports to make this fully useful no matter what you might have in store for it.</h4>

                <p></p>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">With the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), Apple has given its thinnest and slimmest a giant leap forward in performance. The 2020 Air comes with the Apple M1 processor, the manufacturer’s highly-acclaimed, impressively powerful ARM-based chip, under its hood, giving it just the right boost it’s long deserved.
                    Alongside the macOS 11 Big Sur it comes pre-loaded during its release – any MacBook Air M1 you purchase now should either come with the new macOS Monterey or have a free upgrade to it, it has become among the most powerful thin and light laptops. It boasts improvements in performance, as well as better power-efficiency and longer battery life, while sticking with the same pricing as its predecessor ($999 / £999 / AU$1,599), the MacBook Air (2020).                    
                    The MacBook Air (M1, 2020), therefore, offers upgraded internals without any additional cost. So, if you weren’t swayed by the Intel-based model, then maybe this one will change your mind. It also remains our pick for the best laptop in the world right now.</h4>

                <img src="assets/images//0_macbook_tv.jpg">
                <p></p>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Apple has managed to reinvent one of its most iconic products with the release of the iMac (24-inch, 2021) by not only improving upon its predecessor but doing so in stunning fashion. Where the previous iMac had started to look outdated with its hand-me-down looks, the 2021 model is refreshing with its modern and svelte shape.
                    Part of this design overhaul is the size of the screen. The 21.5-inch display is now gone, replaced by the larger 24-inch one (though the 27-inch iMac is still available). While the screen is much larger, the dimensions of the iMac (24-inch, 2021) is not remarkably different from its predecessor, coming in at 54.7 x 46.1cm with a depth of 14.7cm while the prior 21.5-inch model measures 52.8 x 45cm with a depth of 17.5cm. Incredibly, the screen on this iMac is only 11.5mm thin.   
                    So, this model gives you all that extra screen real estate while not taking up much more desk space. And, considering the fact that it is slimmer and lighter as well – the 24-inch model weighs 4.48kg compared to its predecessor’s 5.68kg – it’s an even more portable and flexible all-in-one computer.</h4>
